        Formula i have used a method for calculating power
        Math.pow is a built-in Java method that calculates a number raised
        to a power. It takes two parameters:
        Base (the number being raised)
        Exponent (the power to raise it to)
        The syntax is: Math.pow(base, exponent)
        For example:
        Math.pow(2, 3)    // means 2Â³ = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
         */
        distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + Math.pow(y2 - y1, 2));
        System.out.print("The Distance is " + distance);
    }
